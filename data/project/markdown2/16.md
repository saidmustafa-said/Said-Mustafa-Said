## **Objective:**

The objective of this project was to improve scalability by separating an existing EC2 instance running both the application and two databases (Milvus and Supabase), and implementing auto-scaling for the application.

## Steps Involved:

### 1. Initial Setup:

- The existing infrastructure had a single EC2 instance hosting both the application and two databases (Milvus and Supabase).
- Docker Hub and Docker Compose were used to pull Docker images for these services.
- The EC2 instance was part of the default VPC and located in a public subnet.

### 2. Splitting Application and Databases:

- **Migration**: The application and databases were separated into different EC2 instances.
  - The application was moved to a new EC2 instance.
  - The Milvus and Supabase databases were migrated to another EC2 instance.

### 3. Network Configuration:

- Both EC2 instances were moved from the public subnet to a **private subnet** for improved security.
- A **private IP range** was assigned to each EC2 instance.

### 4. Application Load Balancer (ALB) Setup:

- An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** was configured to manage incoming traffic.
- **Target groups (TG)** were set up to route traffic to the application and database EC2 instances on different ports.

### 5. Auto-Scaling:

- **Auto-scaling** was implemented on the application EC2 instance to dynamically adjust the infrastructure based on traffic loads.

### 6. Routing:

- HTTP path-based routing was configured through the ALB to direct requests to the appropriate EC2 instances based on the service (application or database) and respective ports.

## Skills Required:

- **AWS EC2**: Knowledge of launching, configuring, and managing EC2 instances.
- **VPC & Subnets**: Expertise in configuring VPC, subnets (public/private), and routing for network security.
- **AWS ALB**: Experience with setting up and configuring Application Load Balancers, as well as target groups for traffic routing.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Proficiency in containerization and orchestration using Docker Hub and Docker Compose for pulling and managing images.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Familiarity with configuring AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.
- **Database Management**: Understanding of migrating and managing databases like Milvus and Supabase.
- **Security Best Practices**: Experience with securing infrastructure by using private subnets and controlling access via ALB.
