## Overview

This project focuses on automating the deployment of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Key components include the creation of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), MongoDB setup, EC2 instance configuration, and an Application Load Balancer (ALB) setup.

## Steps Involved

### VPC Setup:

- Designed and deployed a VPC with public and private subnets, routing tables, and Internet gateways.
- Configured security groups to control traffic to EC2 instances and MongoDB.

### MongoDB Deployment:

- Integrated MongoDB with the infrastructure, using appropriate storage and backup mechanisms.
- Ensured secure networking for EC2 instances in the private subnet to connect to MongoDB.

### EC2 Instance Setup:

- Launched EC2 instances with necessary IAM roles and security groups.
- Enabled instances to access MongoDB and serve traffic through the ALB.

### Application Load Balancer (ALB) Setup:

- Configured ALB to distribute traffic across EC2 instances in the private subnet.
- Set up health checks and auto-scaling for EC2 instances.
