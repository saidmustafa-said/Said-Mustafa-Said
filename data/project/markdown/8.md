## Overview:

This project involved setting up AWS infrastructure using Terraform and implementing a CI/CD pipeline to manage deployments across multiple environments (production and staging). The infrastructure included services such as CodePipeline, RDS, VPC, ECS, Redis, ALB, Bastion EC2, SES, Route 53, and SSL certificate management. It also involved multi-environment configurations, hosting migration, and the integration of various AWS services for streamlined deployment and operational efficiency.

## Steps Involved:

### 1. Infrastructure Setup with Terraform:

- **AWS CodePipeline**: Configured for continuous integration and deployment, automating the build and deployment process.
- **Amazon RDS**: Set up as a managed relational database service.
- **Amazon VPC**: Configured for secure and isolated networking.
- **Amazon ECS**: Managed containerized application deployment.
- **Amazon Redis**: Implemented for caching and session management.
- **Amazon ALB (Application Load Balancer)**: Configured to distribute incoming application traffic across ECS tasks.
- **Bastion EC2**: Set up for secure access to the VPC.
- **Amazon SES (Simple Email Service)**: Configured for sending emails.
- **Amazon Route 53**: Managed DNS service, including domain hosting and routing.
- **SSL Certificate**: Set up for secure HTTPS connections.
- **Environment Creation**: Created separate environments for production and staging.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Setup:

- **CodePipeline Configuration**: Automated the build and deployment pipeline.
  - **Source Stage**: Pulls the latest code from the repository.
  - **Build Stage**: Builds Docker images and pushes them to Amazon ECR.
  - **Deploy Stage**: Deploys the latest Docker images to ECS.

### 3. ECS Configuration:

- **Container Deployment**: Configured ECS to pull the latest Docker images from ECR and deploy them.
- **Service Management**: Managed ECS services to ensure proper scaling and load balancing.

### 4. Routing and Domain Management:

- **Route 53 Migration**: Migrated domain management to Route 53 for better DNS control.
- **ALB Configuration**: Set up to route traffic to ECS services.
- **SSL Certificate**: Applied to secure communication between clients and the application.

### 5. Multi-Environment Setup:

- **Production Environment**: Configured for live application usage with all necessary integrations.
- **Staging Environment**: Set up for testing and validation before production deployment.

### 6. Integrations:

- **Redis Integration**: Used for caching and session management to improve application performance.
- **SES Integration**: Configured to handle email notifications and communications.
- **ALB and ECS**: Configured to ensure seamless traffic distribution and container management.

## Skills Required:

### Terraform:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Wrote Terraform configurations to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **Service Setup**: Configured AWS services including CodePipeline, RDS, VPC, ECS, Redis, ALB, Bastion EC2, SES, Route 53, and SSL certificates.

### AWS Services:

- **CodePipeline**: Managed CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
- **RDS**: Managed relational databases.
- **VPC**: Configured secure networking.
- **ECS**: Deployed and managed containerized applications.
- **Redis**: Implemented caching and session management.
- **ALB**: Managed application traffic distribution.
- **Bastion EC2**: Provided secure access to the network.
- **SES**: Handled email communications.
- **Route 53**: Managed DNS and domain routing.
- **SSL Certificates**: Secured HTTPS connections.

### CI/CD:

- **CodePipeline**: Automated build, push, and deployment processes.
- **ECR**: Managed container image repository.
- **ECS Deployment**: Automated container deployments using the latest Docker images.

### Multi-Environment Management:

- **Production and Staging**: Configured separate environments for different stages of deployment.

### Routing and Domain Management:

- **Route 53**: Managed DNS settings and domain hosting.
- **ALB Configuration**: Ensured proper traffic routing and load balancing.
