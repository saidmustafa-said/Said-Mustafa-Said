## Overview:

In this project, I used Terraform to automate the provisioning of AWS infrastructure services, including Elastic Beanstalk, API Gateway, Lambda, and SageMaker. This infrastructure supported machine learning model training and deployment. I also worked closely with a customer to debug and optimize a machine learning model in SageMaker, improving its performance by rewriting parts of the ML script.

## Steps Involved:

### Terraform Infrastructure Setup:

- **Elastic Beanstalk:** Deployed the Django web application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easy scaling and management.
- **API Gateway:** Configured API Gateway to securely expose the SageMaker model's predictions to the web application.
- **Lambda:** Created AWS Lambda functions to handle image processing and invoke the SageMaker endpoint for inference.
- **SageMaker:** Set up SageMaker infrastructure for model training and endpoint creation.

### Model Debugging and Tuning:

- Collaborated with the customer to debug performance issues and optimize model training in SageMaker notebooks.
- Rewrote portions of the machine learning script to build models from scratch using different techniques, focusing on improving model accuracy and performance.

### Website and ML Integration:

- Built a Django-based web application hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- The application allowed users to upload images, which were stored in an S3 bucket.
- Configured AWS Lambda to trigger image retrieval from S3 and invoke the SageMaker endpoint.
- The SageMaker model processed the image, and the result (with bounding boxes and labels) was returned to the user, allowing them to download the processed image.

### Deployment and Endpoint Configuration:

- Deployed the trained model to SageMaker and created an endpoint for real-time inference.
- Integrated the endpoint with the web application via Lambda and API Gateway.

## Skills Required:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Advanced proficiency in Terraform to automate AWS services (Elastic Beanstalk, API Gateway, Lambda, SageMaker).
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Expertise in optimizing and debugging machine learning models in SageMaker.
- **Model Deployment:** Experience in deploying models in SageMaker and creating real-time inference endpoints.
- **Web Development:** Built and deployed a Django web application with integration to SageMaker for ML predictions.
- **Serverless Architectures:** Configured AWS Lambda to handle image processing and ML model invocation.
- **AWS Integration:** Managed end-to-end integration of AWS services including Lambda, SageMaker, S3, and API Gateway.
- **Boto3:** Utilized Boto3 for handling image upload, processing, and retrieval between the web app, S3, and SageMaker.
