## Overview:

In this project, I utilized Terraform to automate the provisioning of a complex AWS infrastructure that included a VPC, CloudFront, EC2 instances, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), ElastiCache, Amazon MQ, and S3. This setup aimed to ensure high availability, scalability, and secure traffic management.

## Steps Involved:

### 1. VPC Setup:

- Created a VPC with public and private subnets, along with the necessary routing tables and NAT gateways.
- Implemented security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for different services, including EC2, ElastiCache, and Amazon MQ.

### 2. CloudFront Distribution:

- Set up a CloudFront distribution to serve content stored in S3 with low latency and high security.
- Configured CloudFront with SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication and implemented caching strategies to improve performance.

### 3. EC2 Instance Setup:

- Deployed EC2 instances within the private subnet for application hosting.
- Configured appropriate IAM roles, security groups, and auto-scaling policies to handle traffic efficiently.

### 4. Application Load Balancer (ALB):

- Configured ALB to distribute traffic across EC2 instances based on health checks.
- Set up secure listener rules with HTTPS to ensure encrypted communication.

### 5. ElastiCache Deployment:

- Deployed ElastiCache (Redis) to improve application performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- Configured the connection between EC2 instances and ElastiCache to optimize latency.

### 6. Amazon MQ Setup:

- Deployed Amazon MQ for message queueing, enabling asynchronous communication between application components.
- Ensured the correct network configuration to allow EC2 instances to communicate with Amazon MQ.

### 7. S3 Bucket Configuration:

- Set up S3 for storing static files and backups with appropriate bucket policies to ensure security.
- Integrated S3 with CloudFront for content delivery and ensured secure access with fine-grained IAM permissions.

## Skills Required:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Advanced proficiency in Terraform for provisioning and managing complex AWS resources.
- **Networking:** In-depth understanding of VPC design, security groups, routing tables, and NAT gateway setups.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDN):** Configured CloudFront for high-performance and secure content delivery.
- **Caching and Messaging Services:** Implemented ElastiCache (Redis) for caching and Amazon MQ for message queueing to enhance system performance and scalability.
- **AWS Services Integration:** Managed the integration of diverse AWS services (VPC, EC2, ALB, S3, ElastiCache, Amazon MQ, CloudFront) to create a cohesive infrastructure.
- **Security:** Applied best practices for IAM role management, SSL/TLS encryption, and securing access to S3 and CloudFront.
