## Project Overview

This project involved designing and implementing a fully scalable, secure, and feature-rich call center system using **Amazon Connect** for a major corporation. The integration brought together a wide array of AWS services, including **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, **Kinesis Data Firehose**, **EventBridge**, **SQS**, **QuickSight**, and **RDS**. The primary objectives were to enhance customer service capabilities, provide real-time data processing, improve customer experience, and enable seamless data visualization for operational insights.

## Steps Involved:

### Amazon Connect:

- **Custom Call Flow Logic**: Designed and implemented an intricate, multi-layered call flow system using over **300 custom logic blocks**.
- **Interactive Voice Response (IVR)**: Built a custom IVR system with dynamic responses and integrated Lambda functions for customer validation.
- **Survey System**: Developed a dynamic survey system, including retry logic and error handling for surveys not recorded.
- **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech**: Integrated **Amazon Polly** and **Amazon Transcribe** for real-time transcription and voice guidance.

### AWS Lambda Functions:

- **API Integrations**: Developed Lambda functions to interact with external APIs for real-time customer data verification.
- **Data Cleansing & Transformation**: Implemented Lambda functions to clean raw data from Amazon Connect before sending it to **S3** and **QuickSight**.
- **Concurrency Control**: Managed data concurrency using **DynamoDB Streams** and Lambda, ensuring no overlap in resource-intensive tasks.

### Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose:

- Configured Kinesis to stream events from Amazon Connect to **S3**, improving data ingestion speed.
- Implemented Lambda transformations to parse and format incoming streams and ensure accurate data storage in **S3**.

### Amazon DynamoDB:

- **Profile Management**: Managed customer data using DynamoDB for storing profiles, call logs, and real-time session data.
- **Locking System**: Implemented a locking mechanism using DynamoDB to manage concurrent updates and prevent data race conditions.
- **DynamoDB Streams**: Triggered Lambda functions to process post-call surveys, customer follow-ups, and real-time updates.

### Amazon S3 and QuickSight Integration:

- **Data Storage**: Utilized **S3** for storing call recordings, survey results, and logs.
- **Data Preparation for Visualization**: Built a data pipeline using Glue ETL jobs and Lambda to prepare data for **QuickSight** dashboards.
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: Created interactive dashboards to display key metrics, including customer satisfaction and agent performance.

### Amazon EventBridge and SQS Integration:

- **Event Filtering**: Configured EventBridge to capture and filter events from Amazon Connect, triggering downstream workflows.
- **SQS for Concurrent Processing**: Leveraged **SQS** to handle large volumes of incoming events, enabling parallel processing via Lambda functions.

### Additional AWS Services and Features:

- Integrated **Amazon Polly** and **Transcribe** for speech-to-text functionality within IVR and call recordings.
- **Amazon RDS** (PostgreSQL) for relational data storage, with secure access via VPC peering.
- Deployed resources within a **VPC** for secure data transfer.
- Configured **CloudWatch** and **X-Ray** for monitoring and debugging system performance.

## Challenges and Solutions:

- **Survey Flow Optimization**: Resolved survey logic errors by revisiting call path management and adding retries for survey triggers.
- **Concurrency and Locking**: Implemented a distributed locking system in DynamoDB to manage access to shared resources.
- **Data Formatting & Cleansing**: Developed Lambda-driven data cleansing processes to address formatting issues before data ingestion into QuickSight.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized Lambda memory and execution times for faster real-time data processing.

## Skills Required:

- **AWS Services**: Expertise in **Amazon Connect**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **S3**, **Kinesis**, **QuickSight**, **EventBridge**, **RDS**, and **SQS**.
- **API Integrations**: Proficient in building integrations with third-party APIs.
- **Data Engineering**: Managed real-time data processing and data quality.
- **Security**: Configured secure data transfer using VPC and IAM roles.
- **Team Leadership**: Led a cross-functional team, coordinating tasks, conducting code reviews, and mentoring on AWS best practices.
