# Overview:

This project involved setting up an AWS infrastructure using Terraform and implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments. The infrastructure included AWS services such as CodePipeline, RDS, VPC, EKS, S3, VPN, and Bastion EC2. YAML configurations were written for service deployment, ingress, and security setups, and GitHub Actions were used for automating the deployment process to Amazon EKS. Secure connectivity was established between EKS and RDS using a VPN.

## Steps Involved:

### 1. Infrastructure Setup with Terraform:

- **AWS CodePipeline**: Configured for continuous integration and deployment, automating builds and deployments.
- **Amazon RDS**: Set up MySQL RDS instances and migrated data from a previous database setup.
- **Amazon VPC**: Configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for secure networking.
- **Amazon EKS**: Deployed and managed Kubernetes clusters for container orchestration.
- **Amazon S3**: Used for storing artifacts, backups, and other necessary data.
- **VPN and Bastion EC2**: Established a VPN for secure communication between EKS and RDS, and configured Bastion EC2 for secure access.

### 2. YAML Configurations:

- **Service YAML**: Wrote YAML files for service configurations, including deployment and ingress setups.
- **Deployment YAML**: Defined deployment settings for the EKS cluster, specifying container specifications and resource allocations.
- **Ingress YAML**: Configured ingress rules to manage external access to services running in the EKS cluster.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Setup:

- **GitHub Actions**: Configured GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment.
  - **Build and Push**: Automated Docker image build and pushed images to Amazon ECR.
  - **Trigger Pipeline**: Set up the pipeline to trigger AWS CodePipeline when code is pushed to GitHub.
  - **Deployment**: Used YAML configurations to deploy updates to the EKS cluster.

### 4. Database Migration:

- **Migration to MySQL RDS**: Performed a database dump and migrated data to MySQL RDS.
- **Configuration**: Ensured proper configurations and access controls for the RDS instance.

### 5. Final Architecture and Project Completion:

- **Architecture Diagram**: Created and finalized the architecture diagram to document the setup and infrastructure components.
- **Project Finalization**: Completed the project by ensuring all components were configured and documented.

## Skills Required:

### Terraform:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Writing Terraform configurations to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **Service Setup**: Configuring AWS services like CodePipeline, RDS, VPC, EKS, S3, VPN, and Bastion EC2.

### AWS Services:

- **CodePipeline**: Used for CI/CD automation.
- **RDS**: Managed database setup and migration.
- **VPC**: Secure networking and resource isolation.
- **EKS**: Kubernetes cluster management.
- **S3**: Used for storage and backup.
- **VPN**: Established secure communication.
- **Bastion EC2**: Provided secure access to the network.

### CI/CD:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated the build, push, and deployment processes.
- **ECR**: Managed container image repository.
- **Deployment Automation**: Automated EKS deployments using YAML configurations.

### Database Migration:

- **MySQL RDS Migration**: Managed database dump and migration processes.

### Documentation:

- **Architecture Design**: Created and finalized the architecture diagrams and documentation.
