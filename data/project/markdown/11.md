## Overview:

This project focuses on setting up a scalable AWS infrastructure using multiple services to ensure proper load balancing, secure communication, and efficient auto-scaling. The objective was to separate backend and frontend services, optimize cost with GPU instances, and automate the infrastructure deployment using Terraform.

## Steps Involved:

### Backend and Frontend Separation in ECS:

- Deployed separate ECS services for the backend and frontend, ensuring modularity and scalability.
- Enabled communication between the frontend and backend to handle incoming requests efficiently.

### 3rd Service in a Separate ECS Cluster:

- Configured a third service in its own ECS cluster to handle additional tasks within the application flow, interacting with the frontend.

### Auto-Scaling Group (ASG) with GPU Instances:

- Set up an EC2 Auto Scaling Group with GPU instances that automatically scale based on traffic load, optimizing cost-efficiency.
- The backend requests these GPU instances during traffic surges for processing.

### Two Application Load Balancers (ALBs):

- **First ALB**: Ensured secure HTTPS communication between the backend and frontend to enforce secure traffic.
- **Second ALB**: Managed other traffic, distributing load efficiently across different service components.

### Terraform Configuration:

- Automated the entire infrastructure setup using Terraform, including VPC creation, ECS services, Auto Scaling Group with GPU instances, and ALB setup, following infrastructure-as-code best practices.

## Skills Required:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Expertise in Terraform for automating and managing AWS resources.
- **Amazon ECS**: Experience in deploying containerized services across multiple ECS clusters.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Configuring and managing EC2 Auto Scaling Groups with GPU resources.
- **Load Balancing**: Using AWS Application Load Balancers for efficient traffic management.
- **VPC and Subnet Design**: Designing secure network architectures with public and private subnets.
- **Amazon EC2 with GPU**: Managing high-performance computing tasks using GPU instances.
- **AWS Services Integration**: Integrating various AWS services like ECS, EC2, ASG, and ALB.
- **AWS Security**: Ensuring secure communication with HTTPS and managing IAM roles and policies effectively.
