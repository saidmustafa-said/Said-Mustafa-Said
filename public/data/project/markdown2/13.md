# Overview:

The objective of this project was to develop and fine-tune an AI model through a structured data collection process, followed by rigorous evaluation to ensure high-quality performance. The final goal was to enhance the AI model’s ability to understand and match specific patterns using custom prompts.

## Steps Involved:

### Data Collection in Phases:

- The data collection process was divided into three phases:
  1. Initially, a core piece of data was gathered.
  2. Additional sets of related data were identified and collected in batches.
  3. For each core data piece, five associated data points were collected to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Evaluation Process:

- For each collected data point, an evaluation was conducted to assess its relevance and fit to the core data. This helped ensure that only high-quality and relevant data was retained for further processing.

### Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:

- The collected data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and noise.
- Various feature engineering techniques were applied to extract useful information, ensuring that the data was structured in a way that would maximize the model’s learning capability.

### Data Organization and Labeling:

- The processed data was organized and labeled to enable supervised learning. This step was critical in helping the AI model understand the relationships between the core data and associated sets in a structured manner.

### Model Fine-Tuning:

- A pre-existing AI model was fine-tuned using the processed and labeled data.
- Specialized libraries were used for fine-tuning, incorporating custom prompt templates to enhance the model's ability to understand and match data patterns more effectively.
- Fine-tuning initially used quantized models for resource optimization. After achieving successful results, the model was converted to its full precision state for final deployment and evaluation.

### Results:

- The fine-tuned model showed significant improvements in understanding and matching structured data.
- Custom prompts and the tailored training process helped achieve more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.
