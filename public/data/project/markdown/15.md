## Overview:

The aim of this project was to utilize large language models (LLMs) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on a set of menu images. The task was to evaluate the readability and understanding capabilities of two different LLMs and to convert the extracted information into a structured JSON format. The project involved processing multiple images, encoding them, and sending the images to the model for interpretation. Additionally, issues with Turkish special characters were addressed by mapping Unicode escape sequences to their respective characters.

## Steps Involved:

### 1. Reading Image Files:

- Processed multiple images (`menu3.png`, `menu4.png`, `menu5.png`) located in two folders (`test1`, `test2`).
- Encoded the images into base64 format for model input.

### 2. Model Interaction:

- Used Amazon Bedrock service to send the encoded images to the Claude 3 Haiku model for interpretation.
- The model was instructed to return menu data in JSON format, with structured categories such as `Category Name`, `Product Name`, `Product Description`, `Product Price`, `Discounted Price`, and `Chex Special Price`.
- Parsed the model response to extract and structure the JSON content.

### 3. Handling Errors:

- Implemented error handling in cases where the model returned no JSON or incomplete data.
- Raw responses were stored and the user was notified of errors.

### 4. Unicode Escape Handling:

- Created a Python function to replace Unicode escape sequences (e.g., `\u00e7` for "รง") with their corresponding Turkish characters.
- Recursively processed the JSON data to ensure all relevant characters were properly replaced.

### 5. Saving and Output:

- Saved the final JSON data, both corrected and raw (if errors occurred), in the respective folder.
- Corrected JSON files with Turkish characters were saved with a `fixed_` prefix in their filenames.

## Key Challenges:

- Ensuring correct parsing of images into structured data by the models.
- Handling Turkish special characters by replacing Unicode escape sequences.
- Implementing robust error handling for incomplete or faulty responses.

## Skills Required:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Proficient in Amazon Bedrock and using the Bedrock Runtime for model interaction.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Familiarity with OCR processes, especially with LLMs for text extraction from images.
- **Large Language Models (LLM):** Expertise in working with LLMs like Claude 3 Haiku for text interpretation and processing.
- **Python Programming:** Skilled in Python for automating image encoding, model interaction, and processing responses using `boto3`, `base64`, `json`, and `re`.
- **Error Handling and Debugging:** Ability to implement error handling for incomplete or erroneous model responses.
- **Unicode Handling:** Experience with character mapping for non-ASCII characters (e.g., Turkish special characters) and custom functions for Unicode correction.
- **JSON Manipulation:** Strong skills in reading and writing JSON files, as well as formatting and manipulating JSON data.
