## Overview:

The project focused on migrating data between two Cassandra clusters, moving from an EC2-hosted environment to an EKS-hosted Cassandra cluster. The primary objectives were to ensure data consistency, minimal downtime during the migration process, and a smooth transition to a Kubernetes-managed environment.

## Steps Involved:

### Source and Target Cassandra Connection:

- Established secure connections to both the source Cassandra cluster on EC2 and the target cluster on EKS.
- Utilized command-line tools for secure user authentication and environment interaction.

### Data Migration with Spark:

- Employed Spark jobs for large-scale data migration between Cassandra clusters.
- Focused on specific keyspaces and tables, optimizing memory and resource usage.
- Migrated data efficiently from the source cluster to the target cluster.

### Data Validation:

- After migration, data validation was performed by comparing the number of records in key tables between the source and target clusters.
- Ensured successful data transfer with no loss.

### Data Bulk Loading:

- Used bulk loading tools for efficient large dataset transfers.
- Exported data from the source Cassandra environment and imported it into the target EKS-hosted Cassandra cluster.

### Schema Replication:

- Replicated the schema of key tables from the source cluster to the target, ensuring consistency.
- Exported the schema from the source and applied it to the target Cassandra database.

### Bulk Unloading and Loading:

- Data was unloaded from the source cluster in a structured format (e.g., CSV).
- Re-loaded data into the target cluster, ensuring data integrity during the transfer.

## Skills Required:

- **Cassandra Administration**: Expertise in managing and migrating Cassandra databases across different platforms.
- **Apache Spark**: Experience in running Spark jobs to migrate large datasets.
- **Data Migration**: Handling large-scale data migrations, ensuring data consistency and validation.
- **EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Understanding of deploying and operating Cassandra on Kubernetes.
- **Linux Command Line**: Proficiency in using the command line for scripting, monitoring, and validating processes.
- **Data Bulk Loading Tools**: Knowledge of tools for efficient data bulk loading and unloading.
- **Schema Management**: Ability to replicate and manage database schemas between clusters.
