## Overview:

This project involved creating an automated AWS infrastructure using Terraform to provision and manage a variety of services for a cloud-based application. Key resources included VPC, EKS, RDS, MongoDB, Elasticache, and Vault HCP for secure management.

## Steps Involved:

### VPC Setup:

- Created a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for isolated networking.
- Configured networking components to ensure secure communication between services.

### Route 53 Configuration:

- Set up Route 53 for DNS management, directing traffic to AWS resources.
- Ensured proper DNS routing for high availability.

### Application Load Balancer (ALB) Deployment:

- Deployed an ALB to efficiently manage incoming traffic.
- Configured the ALB to direct traffic to applications running on EKS.

### EKS Cluster Provisioning:

- Set up an EKS cluster with six services for container orchestration.
- Ensured seamless deployment and management of containerized applications.

### RDS Integration:

- Integrated AWS RDS to handle relational database management for persistent data storage.

### MongoDB Setup:

- Installed and configured MongoDB as a NoSQL solution for handling unstructured data.

### Elasticache Deployment:

- Implemented Elasticache for in-memory data caching, improving system performance and reducing latency.

### Vault HCP Integration:

- Integrated Vault HCP for managing secrets and ensuring secure configuration.

### Service Mesh Implementation:

- Set up a service mesh to manage microservice communication, enhancing observability, security, and traffic management.

### Helm Charts:

- Used Helm charts for the easy deployment and management of Kubernetes applications on EKS.
