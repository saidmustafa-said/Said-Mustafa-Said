## Overview:

The goal of this project was to deploy Kubeflow on Amazon EKS, manage machine learning pipelines, and integrate MLflow for enhanced model tracking and experimentation.

## Steps Involved:

### 1. Initial Setup:

- **System Updates**: Basic system utilities such as `unzip` were installed to prepare the environment.
- **AWS Setup**:
  - AWS CLI was installed and configured for managing AWS resources.
  - An IAM admin user and SSH key pairs were created for cluster setup and management.
- **Kubernetes Tools**: Installed and configured tools like `kubectl` and `eksctl` to manage EKS clusters.

### 2. Cluster Setup:

- **EKS Cluster Creation**:
  - Created a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon EKS with two worker nodes of `t2.2xlarge` instance type.
  - Configured IAM roles and permissions, including Amazon EBS CSI driver for storage management in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Cluster Access**: Configured AWS and `kubectl` to interact with the Kubernetes cluster for full administrative control.

### 3. Juju Setup:

- **Juju Installation**: Deployed Juju, an open-source platform for managing and deploying applications, onto the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Cluster Registration**: Registered the EKS cluster with Juju and bootstrapped a controller to manage the deployed services.
- **Namespace and Model Setup**: Created and verified the Kubeflow namespace, and added a model for resource management.

### 4. Kubeflow Deployment:

- **Kubeflow Deployment**: Deployed Kubeflow using Juju with the latest stable version of the Kubeflow charm bundle.
- **Service Management**: Used Juju to monitor and manage the status of deployed Kubeflow components.
- **External Access Configuration**: Configured external DNS for access to the Kubeflow dashboard.

### 5. MLflow Deployment and Integration:

- **MLflow Deployment**: Deployed MLflow to the Kubernetes cluster using Juju, ensuring proper resource allocation and setting up inotify limits.
- **Kubeflow Integration**: Integrated MLflow with Kubeflow for experiment tracking, including configuring MinIO credentials and linking MLflow to the Kubeflow dashboard and notebook servers.
- **Resource Management**: Deployed a resource dispatcher for seamless resource allocation and secret management within Kubernetes.

### 6. Monitoring and Management:

- **Status Monitoring**: Used Juju and Kubernetes commands to monitor the health of services for high availability and performance.
- **Debugging**: Addressed gateway issues in services by running configuration change commands via Juju.

### 7. Cleanup and Alternatives:

- **Cluster Teardown**: Cleaned up resources by deleting the EKS cluster and unregistering the Juju controller.
- **One-Command Alternative**: Offered a simplified setup with a pre-configured YAML file for quicker deployment.

### 8. Additional Integrations:

- **MLflow-Kubeflow Notebook Integration**: Enabled interaction between Kubeflowâ€™s notebook servers and MLflow for experiment tracking.
- **Example Workflows**: Set up example workflows and notebooks to demonstrate the practical use of MLflow and Kubeflow for machine learning tasks.

## Skills Required:

- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Expertise in setting up and managing AWS resources, particularly EKS.
- **Kubernetes**: Proficiency in deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters with `kubectl` and `eksctl`.
- **MLflow and Kubeflow Integration**: Experience in integrating MLflow for experiment tracking with Kubeflow.
- **Juju Framework**: Knowledge of deploying applications on Kubernetes with the Juju framework.
- **CI/CD Pipelines for ML**: Familiarity with automating ML model deployment and management using Kubernetes-based platforms like Kubeflow.
