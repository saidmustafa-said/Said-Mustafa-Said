## Overview:

This project focused on debugging an AWS environment involving various services such as OpenSearch, RDS, Elasticsearch, VPC, ECS, ALB, S3, and CodePipeline. The main issue was the failure of GPU-enabled EC2 instances to deploy within ECS, while standard EC2 instances deployed successfully. The solution involved identifying the root cause of the deployment issue and resolving it, allowing for successful CI/CD processes.

## Steps Involved:

### Service Integration and Debugging:

- **OpenSearch and Elasticsearch**: Integrated search and analytics services ensuring proper functionality.
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed relational databases for data storage and querying.
- **Amazon VPC**: Configured secure networking and resource isolation for the AWS environment.
- **Amazon ECS**: Used ECS for container orchestration, focusing on deploying both standard and GPU-enabled EC2 instances.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Configured ALB to distribute incoming traffic across ECS instances.
- **Amazon S3**: Leveraged S3 for object storage, including artifacts and logs.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Set up CodePipeline for CI/CD automation, ensuring streamlined deployment processes.

### Issue Identification and Resolution:

- **Problem**: GPU-enabled EC2 instance within ECS failed to deploy while the standard EC2 instance deployed successfully.
- **Troubleshooting Steps**:
  - **Configuration Review**: Checked ECS task definitions and cluster configurations for compatibility with GPU instances.
  - **Resource Limits**: Verified that the VPC and subnet configurations had adequate resources to support GPU instances.
  - **IAM Roles**: Ensured proper IAM roles and permissions for GPU EC2 instance deployment.
  - **Logs Analysis**: Analyzed CloudWatch logs and ECS service events to identify errors or misconfigurations related to the GPU instance deployment.
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - **Configuration Adjustments**: Corrected ECS task definitions, VPC, and IAM roles configurations.
  - **Deployment Testing**: Re-deployed the GPU EC2 instance, confirming a successful launch.
  - **CI/CD Integration**: Verified that the resolution allowed for smooth CI/CD pipeline execution.
